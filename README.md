# Heart Disease Prediction

### **Description**
Machine learning models were created using data from the UCI Machine Learning repository to predict whether or not a patient has heart disease based on several heart health parameters. Ultimately, the best machine learning models were only accurate 90-92% of the time. Although the model is not accurate enough for real world application, there are several data cleaning techniques and interesting visuals that add value to this project.
